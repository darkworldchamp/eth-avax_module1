# Types of Functions

This is a Solidity smart contract demonstrating error handling mechanisms using require, assert, and custom revert functions.

## Contract Details

- **Solidity Version**: ^0.8.0

## Features

### Constructor

The constructor initializes the contract with an initial balance, ensuring it meets a minimum requirement.

### Functions

#### Withdraw Function

- **Function**: `withdraw(uint amount)`
- **Description**: Allows withdrawing a specified amount from the contract balance.
- **Error Handling**: Checks if the contract balance is sufficient to cover the withdrawal amount.

#### Assert Function

- **Function**: `assertFunction()`
- **Description**: Demonstrates the use of `assert` to validate a condition that should always be true. Raises an exception if the condition fails.

#### Revert Function

- **Function**: `revertFunction(uint _amount)`
- **Description**: Custom function showcasing the use of `revert` with a custom error message (`low_balance`) if a condition is not met.

## Usage

### Deployment

1. Compile the contract using Remix, Truffle, or another Solidity development environment.
2. Deploy the compiled contract, ensuring to provide an initial balance of at least 1000.

### Interacting with the Contract

- Use a web3 provider or MetaMask to interact with the contract functions.
- Call `withdraw` to test balance validations.
- Call `assertFunction` and `revertFunction` to explore assert and revert mechanisms.

## Testing

- Develop comprehensive tests to validate error handling scenarios using Solidity testing frameworks like Hardhat or Truffle.
